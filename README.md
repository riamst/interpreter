# Unnamed Language Interpreter
Interpreter for an unnamed language. Written for fun and to learn OCaml. Following "Writing an interpreter in Go (2017) by Thorsten Ball".

The language will mostly follow the Monkey programming language used in the book, but I might decide to change some things.

The goal is to get a functioning REPL with file load capabilities.
